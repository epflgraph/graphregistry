Small-scale notions of stability (Linearization; stability and basin of attraction of an equilibrium point, stability of periodic solutions, Floquet Multipliers). Graphical methods for the analysis of low-dimensional systems. Introduction to structural stability, Bifurcation theory. Introduction to chaotic systems (Lyapunov exponents); time permitting: a review of tools of measure theory to compute Lyapunov exponents.\nThe class is methodology-driven. It may present some limited examples of applications, but it is not application-driven."
